Video player is the interface between a video streaming system and users. 
A general strategy to implement video player is wrapping existing video 
playing cores with a customized GUI. FireWind Player designed such a 
software framework on Windows. ActiveX controls of Windows Media Player, 
RealPlayer, and Adobe Flash Player work as video playing cores. GUI is 
implemented with an Adobe Flash file (.swf), which interacts with its 
owner software (FireWind Player) via the interface of Adobe Flash Player. 
Obviously, The video formats and streaming protocols supported is 
determined by the playing cores and extendable. The style of GUI (theme) 
can be changed simply with different Flash files (.swf).
